* Phase 1: Let's get some basic key bindings going here:
  - [ ] Exit Chrome with 'C-x C-c'
  - [ ] Open a new tab with 'C-x C-f'
  - [ ] Switch to next tab with 'M-n'
  - [ ] Switch to previous tab with 'M-p'
  - [ ] Can we capture 'M-x' to execute a function?
  - [ ] Close a tab with 'C-x k'
  - [ ] Switch tabs with 'C-x b'
